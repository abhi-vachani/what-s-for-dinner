### History of the Project

We are a team of college students, and often after grocery shopping we have a few leftover ingredients that we don't know how to use or use effectively. Therefore, having an application that can help with giving us an optimal recipe based on the available ingredients can be very helpful in saving time, producing less waste when cooking, and enjopying the process.
