## Project Description

What's for Dinner is a project to help people make tasty meals from selected recipes that are available based on the user's current cooking ingredients and utensils. The input would be the current ingredients a user has at home along with utensils adn the output would should the recipes that a user can make based on their preference, like cuisine, and cooking level, from a beginner to a pro. Favorite recipes could then be saved to be used in the future.

### Product Vision Statement

"What's for Dinner" is an open-source web application aimed at simplifying meal planning and inspiring creativity in the kitchen. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recipe recommendations based on user's dietary preferences and ingredients they have on hand. It also features a grocery list generator and pantry inventory tracker to reduce food waste. Our vision is to create a platform that not only simplifies meal planning but also encourages users to experiment with new recipes and ingredients, ultimately leading to a more sustainable and enjoyable cooking experience.

## History of the Project

We are a team of college students, and often after grocery shopping we have a few leftover ingredients that we don't know how to use or use effectively. Therefore, having an application that can help with giving us an optimal recipe based on the available ingredients can be very helpful in saving time, producing less waste when cooking, and enjopying the process.
